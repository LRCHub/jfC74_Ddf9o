Good morning sister
Why so sad?
They broke your heart
You fell again.
Why is it they never let you
Be the one they miss when they're blue?

Don't you say
You've never been loved
Don't you think
You'll never be loved

Cos I hold your hand
Til the bleeding stops
I hold your hand
Til you fall apart
And dream
Your endless dream

Good morning brother
I'm so sad
They broke my heart
I fell again
Why is it then never want me
To be the one that they want to see?

And it feels
Like I've never been loved
And it seems
Like I'll never be loved

I hold your hand
Till the bleeding stops
I hold your hand
Till you fall apart
And dream
Your endless dream

One by one they get you where you are now
And you'll be further down that road
If you don't stop fighting this war
One by one they tear up your heart
With their coldness and words
One by one you stop to feel
Your bleeding knees and heart
And everything that's real

I hold your hand
Till the bleeding stops
I hold your hand
Till you fall apart
I hold your hand
Till you wave goodbye
I hold your hand
Till judgment day
When you dream
Your endless dream
