Hold your head up high, you know you've come a long way, long way
Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say
Temptation may come, but my vision doesn't stray
In the name of God, let me first away

I look forward to the only place you know
Side track, basin and discretion changing as you go
Temptation may come, but my conscience doesn't wait
On this trip you take it's a long fight

It's the last time telling myself everything
Call me over, then bring me back again
It's the last chance telling myself I believe
You're forever is mine and all I need
Now, life, tell me now in your arms
All I really need is you by my side

I'll save this for you, all the world and all it is
I'll bring this to you, this gift of love

(And the world turns)
(And the world turns)
Time tells all we know we look to it (and the world turns)
Jesus on the radio
Pledge me what you got I'll give you
Eternal resting spot
How intense I pray depends on how much you pay

It's the first time, getting it, this life
Fist calling, In a silent spring
It's the first time, getting it, this life
Fist calling, In a silent spring
Fear! strikes!
Deeper than vissionary
Screams an tears, never justify this love

Coming in through the light

Talk! Talk!
Listening (ever to) Reach out
Talk! Talk!
In a silent spring
Talk! Talk!
Listening (Ever to) reach out
Like the first sounds (Talk)
You start to sing

So take your time
Look 'round and see
The most in time
Is where you're meant to be

For they talk too loud
And take the hope and peace
From your heart
We call this surrender
Slowly towards the north
And this endless dream,

Giving ourselves everything
We're deserving,
We're gonna bring it back again
It's the first time, telling myself
Everything
It's the last time bring me back,
Bring me back,
Bring me back again
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
For the love you can find
(Bring me back home)
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
When the world brings you down
(I've waited so long)

When the world brings you down
(You gotta play this living game)

So take your time
Look 'round and see
The most in time, is where you're
Meant to be
For you are light
Inside your dreams
For you will find, that it's
Somenthing that touches me
